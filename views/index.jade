                    p We believe working with the education industry to successfully deliver IT projects requires a tailored approach which takes into account the industry's distinct characteristics.

                    p We seek to work with public and private sector organisations on small or medium-sized projects relating to the following areas.

                    p However we are happy to discuss work outside of these areas on a case-by-case basis.
